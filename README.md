# Machine Learning with Artificial Intelligence Course Workouts

## Overview

This repository contains the workout files and materials completed during the Machine Learning with Artificial Intelligence course at STC Skills. Throughout the course, I gained proficiency in various technologies and concepts, including Python programming, Pandas, NumPy, and a range of machine learning algorithms.

## Course Content

The course covered the following key topics:

- **Python**: A versatile programming language widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence projects.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library for Python, essential for data analysis and preprocessing tasks.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Explored various machine learning algorithms for tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

## Workout Files
